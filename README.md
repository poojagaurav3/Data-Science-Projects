#KNN Implementation:

## Execution:

Added a flag `-f` to provide the file path for the dataset as the input. The program would evaluate all datasets in case no input provided.

## Usage:

- Use car dataset:
    ```
    python3 KNn_code.py -f car.csv
    ```
- Use breast cancer dataset:
```
    python3 KNn_code.py -f breast-cancer.csv
    ```
- Use Hayes Roth dataset:
```
    python3 KNn_code.py -f hayes-roth.csv
    ```
- Use All datasets (output attached as output.txt):
```
    python3 KNn_code.py
    ```
